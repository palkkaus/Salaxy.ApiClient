The .Net Client libraries for Salaxy Open API

Salaxy.Client
-------------

The main core client library for Salaxy Open API. This library is used to interact with Salaxy Open API.
It resolves the issue that adding enumeration values is not considered a breaking change in the Salaxy API,
but adding enum values breaks .Net clients generated by Visual Studio.

To use the Salaxy.Client library, you need to add the following NuGet package to your project:

```csharp
Salaxy.Client
```

For a simple test to connect to Salaxy API, you may create a console application and add the following code:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(await Salaxy.Client.Tester.QuickAnonTest());
```
